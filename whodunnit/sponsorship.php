        <p>
        However, unlike many of them, we aren't going to annoy you with a "curtain" speech, nag you as you leave the theatre or phone you at dinnertime, asking for your pledge. We're hoping that, because of the good work that we do, you'll want to support our efforts.<hr></div><!-- paragraph END-->
