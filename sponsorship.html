      <div class="content">
        <div class="paragraph">If you've read the program of any theater group, you probably know that ticket sales cover only a small portion of the funds needed to operate. Like most theater groups, we rely on corporate and individual contributions for our support.
        <p>
        However, unlike many of them, we aren't going to annoy you with a "curtain" speech, nag you as you leave the theatre or phone you at dinnertime, asking for your pledge. We're hoping that, because of the good work that we do, you'll want to support our efforts.<hr></div><!-- paragraph END-->
        </div>

      <div class="headline"><h3>What are the benefits for you?</h3></div><!-- headline END -->
      <div class="content">
        <div class="paragraph">WhoDunnit is a 501(c)3 non-profit corporation for the performing arts. Your donations are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. In addition, sponsor benefits ($500 contribution and up) include a promotional announcement about you or your company at the beginning of a sponsored show, sponsorship signs in the performance area, two free tickets with preferred seating, and much more.

        <p>
        Our operating expenses are daunting -- costumes, props, sets, historical research, staff to manage your reservations efficiently, phone and Internet resources, sound and lighting equipment, road crew and techicians ... so much goes into making a quality production. Your contribution keeps what's happening behind the scene running smoothly, so that we can keep the magic happening on stage!<hr></div><!-- paragraph END-->

        <p>
        Your contribution helps to subsidize these. We also welcome first-timers (adults with talent and initiative but limited stage experience) and students as young as 17 to our auditions, providing training and guidance. WhoDunnit has given many now-successful performers and directors their first professional role.<hr></div><!-- paragraph END-->

Sponsorship of an entire year (four full productions, running seven to nine weeks each) is $5000.
        <p>
        You can also help out by purchasing a season ticket by December of each year.<hr></div><!-- paragraph END-->
